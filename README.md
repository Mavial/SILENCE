# SILENCE
### System for Identifying Loud Environments and Neutralizing Conversation Effectively

A tool to measure your microphone volume and play an alarm sound if you talk too loud.

## Usage

Python 3 is needed to run the source code. You can run the following command to install all the required modules:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, just run the following command to start the program (or double click `Scimia.py`, if you have your Python configured to automatically run all `.py` extensions):
```
python Scimia.py
```

However, there is also a compiled binary in the `exe version` folder. You can run it by double clicking the `Scimia.exe` file.

The threshold is typically around `100`.
